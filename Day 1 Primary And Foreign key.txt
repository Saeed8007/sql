 --> PRIMARY KEY :
        
        *  What is Primary Key ?
	primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.
	It serves as a fundamental constraint to ensure data integrity and is crucial for establishing relationships with other tables. 

	
	*  The most significant advantages of a primary key are:
	It uniquely identifies each row of a table
	It gets a unique index for each primary key column that helps with faster access


	*  The properties of each primary key column or columns are:
	It enforces uniqueness by not accepting any duplicate values
	A primary key uniquely identifies each field
	A table can only take one primary key
	Primary columns have a maximum length of 900 bytes

	create database FirstProject
	use FirstProject
	CREATE TABLE ProjectOne (StudentId int primary key, name  varchar(20),age int, Coures varchar(20),Fees int )
   	insert into ProjectOne values (1,'saeed',20,'DSD',10000)
	Select * from ProjectOne


	

 --> FOREIGN KEY :

	*  What is FOREIGN KEY
	The FOREIGN KEY constraint is a key used to link two tables together.
	A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.


	*  The most significant advantages of a foreign key are:
	Data Integrity: Prevents invalid data entries by enforcing relationships between tables.
	Maintains Referential Integrity: Guarantees that references between tables are always valid, avoiding broken links.


	*  The properties of each foreign key column or columns are:
	References a Primary/Unique Key: The values in the foreign key column(s) must correspond to existing values in the referenced primary key column(s) of another table (or the same table) or a column(s) with a unique constraint. 
	Data Type Compatibility: The data type(s) of the foreign key column(s) must be compatible with the data type(s) of the referenced primary/unique key column(s).
	Enforces Referential Integrity: The database system uses the foreign key constraint to enforce rules regarding data consistency between the related tables.

	* Example of Foreign Key
	CREATE DATABASE intern;
	USE intern;
	CREATE TABLE customer (customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,customer_Name VARCHAR(20),city VARCHAR(20));
	INSERT INTO customer VALUES (1, 'Anas', 'Sillod');
	INSERT INTO customer VALUES (2, 'Ali', 'Aurangabad'); 

	
	SELECT * FROM customer;
	CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,Age int,customer_id INT,FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id));
	INSERT INTO orders VALUES (1, 20, 2);
	SELECT * FROM orders;
